Hi folks,

This is Ki and I am currently a principal machine learning research engineer at [MakinaRocks](http://makinarocks.ai). In recent years, I am focusing on Anomaly Detection in Industrial Manufacturing -- [Talks on DEVIEW 2019](https://deview.kr/2019/schedule/286).

My original specialty is Natural Language Generation, such as [Neural Machine Translation (NMT)](https://github.com/kh-kim/simple-nmt). I have many experiences in NLP research and productions. Through many years of experience, I wrote a [book](http://www.yes24.com/Product/Goods/74802622) about NLP, and I am running a class for NLP and NLG.
